				<p>Hello! I'm Nam Nguyen, a dedicated and passionate Computer Science student at the University of Utah,
					where I've honed my skills in programming languages like Java, C++, C#, and more. My journey in
					technology began at Emerson College, where I studied Media Production, fueling my creative side and
					leading me to produce several short films since my high school days.</p>

				<p>My curiosity and drive have led me to the world of game development. I've crafted a variety of games and programs,
					such as an educational puzzle game and sprite editor designed using C++ and Qt Framework. This hands-on experience has not only
					sharpened my programming skills but also allowed me to dive into the creative process of generating
					assets and animations using tools like Photoshop, Maya, and Unreal Engine.</p>

				<p>My journey isn't just about coding and creating; it's also about connecting and collaborating. I
					pride myself on my strong communication skills and my ability to work effectively in team
					environments. I've consistently delivered quality results and believe in the power of teamwork and
					shared vision.</p>
				<p>As I continue on this exciting path in computer science, I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute to
					innovative projects. Whether it's developing engaging games or exploring new technologies, I am
					committed to bringing my blend of technical skills and creative insights to make a meaningful
					impact.</p>
